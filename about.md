I'm an assistant professor at the <a href="http://www.univ-nantes.fr">University of Nantes</a>, where I teach different topics related to Software Engineering.
			
Since 2015, I lead the <a href="http://web.emn.fr/x-info/atlanmod/">AtlanMod</a> research team, which is part of the [LS2N](https://ls2n.fr) research laboratory.
			
AtlanMod is working intensively on improving and promoting the base techniques, best practices and actual usages of Model-Based Engineering (MDE) by paying equally attention to both the academic & industrial problems, and notably investigating on the benefits that can be brought by a rigorous use of models in a software engineering context.
			
From this research effort, an open source model-based toolbox is being developed and proposed (notably via the worldwide Eclipse Community) to software engineers & architects with the objective of improving their productivity as well as increasing the quality of the applications they design and build.
				
				
My research topics are related to Model-Based Engineering, Software Testing, and Distributed Systems.
			Put differently, I apply model-based techniques to test distributed systems.
